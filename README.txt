Project Description

In this project, we aim to predict the likeliness of a stroke in patients based on their medical data.
Stroke prediction is crucial for early intervention and improving patient outcomes.
We will explore and implement various machine learning methods, analyze their performance, and discuss the methods used.
Our goal is to compare the results to identify the most effective approach for stroke prediction.
